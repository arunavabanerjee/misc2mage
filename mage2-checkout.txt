The checkout in Magento 2 is built up from a series of Knockout JS components which are then rendered using 
the Knockout JS templating system. Magneto 2 defines each one of these components and their parent / child 
relationship in a large XML file which can be extended or overridden in your own theme or module.
Magento 2 parses the XML file and runs it through the layout processor which processes each XML node and reads 
its configuration, which it then inserts into a large multi-dimensional associative array,where each key 
represents a component or a group of components within.
This Array is then converted into a JSON object which is then passed into the main app checkout component 
(Magento_Ui/js/core/app) on the main checkout template file (onepage.phtml) and initialised.
